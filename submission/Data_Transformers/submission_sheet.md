## Section 2 — Data Strategy

Did you use any external data beyond the provided train.csv?

- **Yes / No** No

If yes, fill the table below for each source:

| Source Name | URL | Rows Used | Why It Was Relevant |
|-------------|-----|-----------|---------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

How did you verify the external data was clean and trustworthy?

**Answer:**

---

## Section 3 — Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

How did you handle missing values? Which columns had them and what did you do?

**Answer:** By replacing mean of the column.

Did you find any noisy or suspicious labels in the training data? What did you do about them?

**Answer:** No

Was the data imbalanced? How did you handle it (if at all)?

**Answer:** No

Any other transformations you applied (scaling, encoding, outlier removal)?

**Answer:** Yes, Scaling & Encoding.

## Section 4 — Feature Engineering

What were your top 3 most important features and why?

| Rank | Feature | Why It Matters |
|------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | | | Standard Scaling | Speed of training |
| 2 | | | One hot Encoding | Ml models cannot understand text |
| 3 | | | Feature Selection | Makes model easier to interprete |

Did you create any new features that were not in the original dataset?

**Answer:** No

Did you drop any features? Which ones and why?

**Answer:** No

Did you check for correlations or feature interactions? What did you find?

**Answer:** No

## Section 5 — Model Selection and Training

What is your final model?

**Answer:** Logistic regression

What other models did you try before this? Why did you pick the final one over them?

| Model Tried | Validation Score | Why You Rejected / Kept It |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Logistic regression |  | Kept It |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |

What hyperparameters did you tune? What values did you settle on?

**Answer:**

How did you validate your model? (train/test split, cross-validation, etc.)

**Answer:** train/test split

What was your best validation score before submitting?

**Answer:** 

---

## Section 6 — Honest Reflection

What did you try that did NOT work?

**Answer:** 

What are the known limitations of your model?

**Answer:** Model is biased

What was the hardest part of this challenge for your team?

**Answer:** Feature Encoding

If you had 6 more hours, what would you do differently?

**Answer:** Error decrease,Improve speed , Improve Accuracy
